## ✅ Verification Status

### What's VERIFIED (use on resume NOW)
✅ 80+ repositories across 15 GitHub organizations
✅ 115 operator scripts, 24,520 lines of code
✅ 269 commits to primary operator repo (all authored by you)
✅ 63,726 LOC in operator repo (Python + TypeScript)
✅ 6-core multi-AI registry (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Lucidia, Alice, Aria)
✅ 9 registered production agents
✅ 88 Amundson Equations (6,582 LOC TypeScript)
✅ Light Trinity system (429 emojis, 15 lifecycle states)
✅ 438 memory system journal entries (PS-SHA-∞ chain)

✅ 4 Raspberry Pi mesh nodes
✅ ~4-5 deployments/week (Dec 2025)
✅ 100% GitHub Actions pinned to SHAs
✅ 10+ test files, 1300+ LOC test coverage

### What's PROPOSED (implement in 90 days)
⏳ Deployment cycle time <10 min (add timing hooks)
⏳ MTTR <15 min (add incident logging)
⏳ 99.5% uptime (add health check cron)
⏳ API latency P95 <200ms (add FastAPI middleware)
⏳ Deployment success rate 98% (add outcome logging)
⏳ 96% time reduction (document before/after)

### What's UNVERIFIED (don't claim yet)
❌ Runtime agent count (description says 1000+, only 9 registered locally)
❌ Production uptime metrics (no monitoring data)
❌ Actual MTTR numbers (no incident tracking)
❌ Measured latency percentiles (no instrumentation)

---

## 📊 Overall Confidence Score

**85/100 (HIGH)**

**Why not 100%:**
- Some scale claims from repo descriptions (not runtime verification)
- Performance improvements estimated (not measured with timing data)
- Production reliability metrics not yet instrumented

**Path to 95/100:**
- Implement 90-day measurement plan
- Add instrumentation (latency, uptime, deploy timing)
- Run production for 30 days with metrics collection
- Update resume with measured KPIs

---

## 🔨 Next Steps (Recommended)

### Week 1-2: Measurement Setup
- [ ] Add deployment timing to GitHub Actions
- [ ] Create health check cron (every 5 min)
- [ ] Add latency middleware to FastAPI
- [ ] Create `~/blackroad-metrics.sh` dashboard script

### Week 3-4: Data Collection
- [ ] Collect 2 weeks of metrics baseline
- [ ] Document in METRICS_BASELINE.md
- [ ] Identify any P95 latency issues

### Month 2: Optimization
- [ ] Fix any performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Rotate all credentials (SSH keys, API tokens)
- [ ] Enable Dependabot on all repos
- [ ] Improve self-healing workflows

### Month 3: Reporting
- [ ] Generate 90-day metrics report
- [ ] Update resume with verified KPIs
- [ ] Create 2-3 case studies with numbers
- [ ] Build public portfolio site
