## Who I Am

FINRA-licensed financial professional (Series 7/63/65) who generated $23M+ in annuity sales, identified $18.4M in convertible AUM, and built the data pipelines that drove 75% of lead generation — then engineered a full distributed AI orchestration platform from scratch across 6 compute nodes, 48+ domains, and 130+ Cloudflare Workers.

I bring quantitative analysis from regulated finance and production-grade infrastructure engineering in a single package.
